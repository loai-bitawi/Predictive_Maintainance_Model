This project aims to predict whether a customer would experience a technical fault or not for the next 7 days, 
given the input parameters of his line through thepast 7 days. 

8 algorithms were applied to data with cross validation with 10 folds. 

The algorithms were: 
(1) Logistic Regression 
(2) K-Nearest Neighbor
(3) Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes
(4) Support Vector Machine
(5) Linear SVC
(6) Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier
(7) Random Forest Classifier
(8) Gradient Boosting Classifier

There is a paper-based document that describes the project (Broadband Network Fault Prediction. Case Study in Palestinian Telecommunication Company.pdf)
